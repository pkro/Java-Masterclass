Good description:

Here's a detailed description of the abstract class challenge. It is a good idea to study up on tree traversal and the binary search tree before attempting this challenge.

ListItem Class:

1. Create a new abstract class called ListItem

2. Create the fields of type ListItem with null as their initial values. They should use the protected access modifier:

  - rightLink

  - leftLink

3. Create a field called value, of type Object. It should use the protected access modifier.

3. Create the following abstract methods. They should be also of type ListItem:

- next()

- setNext(ListItem item)

- previous()

- setPrevious(ListItem item)

4. Create getters and setters for the field "value".


NodeList Interface:

1. Create an interface called NodeList. Note that interfaces are public and abstract by default

2. create a method getRoot() of type ListItem

3. create two boolean method, called addItem and removeItem. These boolean methods should have a parameter called "item" of type ListItem.


ListItem

1. Create a new class called Node, which should extend the class ListItem

2. Create a constructor for Node

3. Override the setNext(ListItem item) method. You should assign "this.rightLink" with value "item", and return "this.rightLink".

4. Override the next() method. You should return "this.rightLink".

5. Override the setPrevious(ListItem item) method similar to how you override the setNext(ListItem item) method in step 3.

6. Override the previous(ListItem item) method similar to how you override the previous() method.

7. Override the compareTo method.


MyLinkedList Class

// work in progress, more details filled in soon...

1. Create a new class called MyLinkedList, which should implement the NodeList interface.

2. Create a private field called root of type ListItem

3. Override the getRoot() method.

4. Override the addItem(ListItem newItem) method.

-  if this.root == null, you need to assign this.root to the value newItem, then return true

- think about the conditions for adding items, if no duplicates are allowed. Hint: You need something along the lines of currentItem.compareTo(newItem) and check what happens if this value is less than 0, when it is exactly 0 or when it is greater than 0.

5. Override the boolean removeItem(ListItem item) method.

6. Override the traverse(ListItem root) method.

-  If root is null, the traverse method should print out "The List is empty".

-Otherwise, while root is not null, print out root.getValue() using System.out.println, then assign the value "root.next()" to the variable root.


Main:

1. Create a new instance of MyLinkedList, called list.

2. You will need to use the .traverse() and .getRoot()  methods to traverse the tree.

3. You are given a random string of numbers. In this example I will use the string,"5 7 3 9 8 2 1 0 4 6", but this should work for any arbitrary string. You need to process the data using the .split() method.

4. You need to use a for loop to add the corresponding new Nodes into the tree based on that string of numbers.

4. Now to test your method, paste the following code into your main method.

            list.traverse(list.getRoot());
            list.removeItem(new Node("3"));
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());

            list.removeItem(new Node("5"));
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());

            list.removeItem(new Node("0"));
            list.removeItem(new Node("4"));
            list.removeItem(new Node("2"));
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());

            list.removeItem(new Node("9"));
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());
            list.removeItem(new Node("8"));
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());
            list.removeItem(new Node("6"));
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());
            list.removeItem(list.getRoot());
            list.traverse(list.getRoot());

Your output should be so that all items are removed from the tree and you should be able to print "The list is empty" at the very end. This should be because you were able to satisfy the "if root == null" condition specified in the MyLinkedList class's method.

There should not be a single System.out.println() method in your main class.

bad description:

Create an abstract class to define items that can be stored in a tree.

Implement the following:

1.  ListItem (abstract class)

    -  It has three protected fields. Two ListItems called rightLink and leftLink, and an Object called value.

    -  A constructor that takes an Object and initialises the field value with the parameter that was passed in.

    -  And seven methods:

        -  next(), setNext(), previous(), setPrevious() and compareTo() which are package-private and abstract (see child class for declaration).

        -  getValue(), takes no parameters and returns its value.

        -  setValue(), takes an Object and assigns it to value.

       

2.  Node (concrete class)

    -  It extends ListItem.

    -  It has a constructor that takes an Object, then calls its parent constructor with the parameter that was passed in.

    -  And five methods which are package-private:

        -  next(), takes no parameters and returns the ListItem to its right.

        -  setNext(), takes a ListItem and sets it as its rightLink, then it returns rightLink.

        -  previous(), takes no parameters and returns the ListItem to its left.

        -  setPrevious(), takes a ListItem and sets it as its leftLink, then it returns leftLink.

        -  compareTo(), takes a ListItem and compares it to the ListItem that called this method. Use value from ListItem for comparison. If this value is greater than the value that was passed in, then it should return a number greater than zero. If vice versa, then it should return a number less than zero, and zero if equal.

3.  MyLinkedList (concrete class)

    -  It implements NodeList.

    -  It has one field of type ListItem called root.

    -  A constructor that takes a ListItem and initialises the field root with the newly passed in parameter.

    -  And four methods:

        -  getRoot(), getter for root.

        -  addItem(), takes a ListItem and returns true if it was added successfully or false otherwise. If the item is already present, it doesn't get added. Use compareTo() to place the item in its proper order.

        -  removeItem(), takes a ListItem and returns true if it was removed successfully or false otherwise.

        -  traverse(), takes the root as an argument and does not return anything. If the root is null it prints out: The list is empty, otherwise print each value on a separate line.

4.  NodeList (interface)

    -  It has four methods:

        -  getRoot(), addItem(), removeItem() and traverse() which are package-private and abstract (see child class for declaration).

5.  SearchTree (concrete class)

    -  It implements NodeList.

    -  It has one field of type ListItem called root.

    -  A constructor that takes a ListItem and initialises the field root with the newly passed in parameter.

    -  And five methods:

        -  getRoot(), getter for root.

        -  addItem(), same as MyLinkedList.

        -  removeItem(), same as MyLinkedList.

        -  performRemoval(), takes two ListItems, the item to be removed and its parent. It doesn't return anything and is declared as private. Call this method from removeItem() when the item is found.

        -  traverse(), takes the root as an argument and does not return anything. It uses recursion to visit all the branches in the tree (Inorder). Print each value on a seperate line.

TIP:  The rules for adding an item to the linked tree are: 

          If the head of the tree is null, make the head refer to the item to be added.

          If the item to be added is less than the current item in the tree, add the item before the current item (i.e., make the previous item's "next" refer to the new item, and the new item's "next" refer to the current item).

          If the item to be added is greater than the current item, move onto the next item and compare again (if there is no next item, then that is where the new item belongs).

TIP:  When adding items to a Binary Search Tree, if the item to be added is less than the current item - then move to the left.

         If it is greater than the current item - then move to the right.

         The new item is added when an attempt to move in the required direction would involve following a null reference.

         Once again, duplicates are not allowed.

TIP:  Inorder = print the previous node, then the parent node, and then the next node (left -> node -> right).

TIP:  Be extremely careful with the spelling of the names of the fields, constructors and methods.

TIP:  Be extremely careful about spaces and spelling in the printed output from the traverse() method.

NOTE:  All fields are private (unless stated otherwise).

NOTE:  All constructors are public.

NOTE:  All methods are public (unless stated otherwise).

NOTE:  Do not add a main method to the solution code.
