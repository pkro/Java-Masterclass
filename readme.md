# Course notes for Java complete masterclass on udemy

## 3. First steps

- **Primitive types are passed by value, Objects by reference; the original object can be changed (if it's not immutable) when passed as a parameter to a method**

### 8 primitive types

- **boolean** (Boolean)
- byte
  - occupies 8 bits ("byte has a **width** of 8")
  - -128 - 127
  - doesn't roll over but gets converted to int when adding number and it gets out of range
  - use to document that expected value is small / in that range
- char
  - must use single quotes: `char myChar = 'D';`
  - width: 16 bit (unicode)
  - unicode assignments are valid: `char arrow = '\U+2190';`
- short
  - width: 16 bit
  - -32768 - 32767
- **int**
  - width: 32 bit
  - used by default by java for numbers
  - when adding 1 to Integer.MAX_VALUE, it overflows (**rolls over**) (to Integer.MIN_VALUE) and reverse
  - when assigning a value hiher than MAX_VALUE, a compiler error occurs
  - for better readability, underscores can be used in numbers (2_010_232 = 2010232), java ^7
- long
  - 64 bit (integer)
  - must be assigned with an "l" or "L" if its over int range: long myLongValue = 100L;
  - long Min: -9223372036854775808
  - long Max: 9223372036854775807
  - **rolls over**
  - works well with int
- float
  - must be defined as literal with f suffix if number literal is a floating point (like *long*): `float x = 1.33f;` or cast directly from double `float x = (float) 1.33;`
  - 32 bit (single precission)
  - float min: 1.4E-45
  - float max: 3.4028235E38
- **double**
  - 64 bit (double precision)
  - default for floating-point numbers
  - Faster to process than double in almost all cases
  - can be defined with d suffix for literal numbers (double d = 5d;)
  - double min: 4.9E-324
  - double max: 1.7976931348623157E308

### Strings

- Class (not a primitive)
- concatenation with + works without explicit casting (`"dfsdfds" + 5;` is fine); 
- "+" concatenation is inefficient, use StringBuffer
- immutable

### Sidenotes: 

- constants in Java are defines as **static** (can be used without creating class instance) **final** (can't change): `private static final double KG_FACTOR = 0.45359237d;`; Must be defined in *class*, not in method
- for precise fp calculations, **BigDecimal** should be used
- Packages: way to organize Java projects; companies use domain names reversed

### Casting

- Integers don't need to be explicitly cast to long
- Syntax:

      (type) value or variable;
      byte x = (byte) (6/2); // default data type is integer so 6/2 gets interpreted as an int by the compiler; as byte range is smaller than int, it needs to be explicitely cast


## Section 4 OperatorsExpressions, Statements, Code blocks
- use camel case, even for abreviations (correct: XmlHttpRequest, incorrect: XMLHTTPRequest)
- methods and variables start with lowercase, classes with uppercase

### Operators
- left / right associative as usual; "=" -> right associative, '+' or '-' left associative
- type comparison: **instanceof**
- precedence: as usual, https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/
- ++ / -- prefix / postfix as usual

### Statements

- syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to determine its value
- A statement is a complete unit of execution (`int x = 5;`)

3 types:

- Declaration statement (`int x = 5;`)
- Expression statement (expressions can become expression statements by adding a semicolon at the end)
  - Assignment expression (`x=5;`)
  - increment / decrement (`x++;`)
  - Method calls (`System.out.println("Test")`)
  - Object creation expressions (`Car ownersCar = new Car();`)
- Control flow statements

### Whitespace / indentation

- Nothing new

### Code blocks

- nothing new, new codeblock = new namespace with visibility of enclosing namespace

### Methods (basic)

- non-static methods can't be called on a non-static context, i.e. without object instantiation
- nothing noteworthy otherwise at this point

### DiffMerge Tool
**this**
- what it says; use something better.

### Methods overloading

- overloaded methods must have a differen parameter signature, a different return type doesn't suffice

### Sidenotes

- `return;` is valid for a void method (NOT `return void;`)

## Section 5 Control Flow

- switch, for, while, do while: nothing unexpected; String type switch added Java 7+

### String / number conversions
- Integer.parseInt() / Double.parseDouble etc.; throws exception if not a valid (integer|double|...) format
- concatenating int to string with "+" automatically converts the int

### User Input (command line)

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    String input = scanner.nextLine();
    scanner.close();

- also nextInt, nextShort, hasNextInt etc. among others
- for multiple inputs that are terminated by enter (enter gets interpreted as the next input), use `scanner.nextLine();` before reading another input:

      System.out.println("Enter your birthyear: ");
      int birthYear = scanner.nextInt();
      System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
      scanner.nextLine();
      String name = scanner.nextLine();

- user input type check pattern:

      System.out.println("Enter your choice: ");
      int choice = -1;
      while(choice == -1) {
        if(scanner.hasNextInt()) {
          choice = scanner.nextInt();
        } else {
          System.out.println("Please enter only numbers.");
        }
        scanner.nextLine();
      }

### Sidenotes
- Example date / formatting / conversion: Condensed getting current year:
  
  `int currentYear = Integer.parseInt(new SimpleDateFormat("YYYY").format(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis())));`

## Section 6 OOP part 1

### Classes

- class files are created in namespace folder, e.g. /de/pkro

      [optional access modifier] class ClassName
      [public|private|protected] class ClassName

- instance variables (=fields) -> state of class (or rather it's derived object)
- refered to inside function with this.varName (if parameter naming conflict, otherwise just varName)

- Object instantiation:

  [Classname] varName = new [Classname]([params])

### Constructor

- method with only access modifier (always public), *no return type* and method name = class name
- to overload a constructor with a constructor that assigns default values, call the constructor that accepts values with "**this**":

      // all parameters
      public BankAccount(long accountNumber, double balance, String customerName, String email, String phoneNumber) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        [...]
      }

      // no parameters
      public BankAccount() {
          this(12345, 0, "Default name", "default email", "default phone");
      }

      // some parameters
      public BankAccount(String customerName, String email) {
          this(12345, 0, customerName, email, "default phone");
      }
  
- generally it's regarded as better to assign the values directly (`this.name = name;`) in the constructor as opposed to using the setters (`setName(name);`) in the constructor; reasons:
  - initial values are guaranteed to be initialized
  - not all variables that are necessary for validation of another value might have been initialized

### Inheritance
- all classes inherit from `Object`
- `public class XXX extends YYY {[...]}`
- constructor call with super

      public class Dog extends Animal {
          public Dog(String name, int brain, int body, int size, int weight) {
              super(name, brain, body, size, weight);
          }
      }

- override methods with **@Override (optional**, hint for compiler / IDE to catch errors when efining overridden methods):

      @Override
      public void eat() {
          super.eat();
          chew();
      }

- if a method has a different signature (but the same name) as the one in the parent class, it's **overloaded** and **not overridden**
- to call methods from the superclass, it's better practice to call them without super in case they are later overrridden (unless the superclass method version should explicitely be called)
- **this** is used to call current class members; usually used in constructors and setters, sometimes in getters
- **super** to call parent class; commonly used in method overriding 
- both can't be used in a static context
- **super()**: Java puts a default call to super() in the constructor to call the argument-less constructor of the parent class if we don't add it ourselves
- the **super()** call must be the first statement in the constructor if it's done explicitely
- Even abstract classes have a constructor
- A constructor can have a call to super() or this() but not both

### Overloading / Overriding

#### Overloading
- Overloading is sometimes refered to as compile time polymorphism (though it isn't polymorphism in the inheritance sense)
- both static and instance methods can be overloaded
- Overloaded = same method name but different parameters, **may or may not** have different return types / access modifiers / exceptions
- usually methods get overloaded in a single class, but a class overloads the parent class' method (no @Override necessary then)

#### Overriding

- aka "runtime polymorphism"
- means defining a method in the child class with the same name and signature as one in the parent class
- recommended to put @Override above method definition to let IDE / compiler catch errors
- only instance methods can be overridden
- return type can (only) be a subclass of the return type in the parent class
- can't have a lower access modifier (e.g. if parent method: protected, child method can be public but not private)
- Constructors and private methods can't be overridden
- Final methods can't be overridden
- subclass can still call overridden method version from parent class by using super.methodName

### Static vs Instance methods

#### Static methods

- can't use this in static methods
- methods that don't use instance variables should be declared static

#### Instance methods

- can only be used in class instance (method)
- can access instance as well as static methods/variables directly

### Static vs instance variables

#### static variables ("static member variables")

- declared with `static`
- shared with all class instances
- **if changed, value in all other instances will change too**
  
      public class StaticVarTest {
        public static int maxSpeed = 100;
      }
      // in main
      StaticVarTest a = new StaticVarTest();
      StaticVarTest b = new StaticVarTest();
      a.maxSpeed = 5;
      System.out.println(b.maxSpeed); // 5

- used for example to instantiate a Scanner that can be used in all methods

#### Instance variables

- every instance has its own copy / value

### Sidenotes

- String comparison with .equals method (`firstName.equals("pkro")`)
- Check if String is empty / uninitialized .isEmpty()
- default toString method outputs classname and object id
- Reference assignments as usual

## Section 7 OOP part 2

### Composition

- Inheritance: "is-a" relationship between subclass and parent class
- Composition: "has-a" relationship: Monitor class has Resolution class
- basically using other classes / types in a class and construction a parent class from other class components

      Dimensions dimensions = new Dimensions(20, 20, 5);
      Case theCase = new Case("22b", "Dell", "240", dimensions);
      Monitor theMonitor = new Monitor("27incher", "Iiyama", 27, new Resolution(2540,1440));
      Motherboard motherboard = new Motherboard("apc200","apc", 4, 2, "1.5");
      PC pc = new PC(theCase,theMonitor,motherboard);

#### how to access methods of components? 

- example: pressPowerButton is defined in Case, but we want to access it from the pc object.
- solution 1: using the getters (duh!):

      pc.getCase().pushPowerButton();
      pc.getMonitor().drawPixelAt(20,30,"green");

- solution 2: making getters in the class that uses the components private (or removing them alltogether) and wrapping the component's methods:
      
In PC class:

      public void powerUp() {
        theCase.pressPowerButton();
        drawLogo();
      }

      public void drawLogo() {
          monitor.drawPixelAt(40, 30, "purple");
          monitor.drawPixelAt(40, 30, "green");
      }

- solution 3: both of the above

#### Where to use inheritance and where composition?

- rule of thumb: composition first as it doesn't create unwieldy class hierarchies
- works well with the functional paradigm
- easier to test / write tests for individual classes

### encapsulation

- encapsulate member variable access in methods
- protects from variable name changes affecting classes using it
- enables checks before accessing members

### Polymorphism

- basically method overloading. Subclass IS-A Parentclass, but Parentclass IS_NOT_A Subclass
- Might want to add more explanations here but this seems intuitive and already covered during method overriding section
- [There obviously is more to it](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3033445/java-101-polymorphism-in-java.html)

### Sidenotes

- Strg-Shift-Space shows method parameters when typing (can be enabled to be always shown)
- "sout"+tab = System.out.println
- Strg-F12 shows method / class implementation (where cursor is)
- classes can be declared inline in the file of another class (e.g. class Main), but then "public" keyword isn't allowed as the class can't be accessed from outside the file.

## Section 8

### Reference Types vs Value Types

- nothing surprising, primitives are passed / assigned by value, Objects (such as Arrays) by reference
- methods can dereference (=re-initialize) array references passed in parameters:
- parameters are just copies of the pointers to the object

      public static void doSomething(int[] array) {
        array[2] = 2; // modifies array referenced by "array"
        // overwrite / dereference reference LOCALLY
        array = new int[] {1,2,3}; // creates new array and references it by "array"
      }

### Arrays
- nothing surprising index-wise or standard properties like .length
- can hold all types
- typed (no mixed content)
- Array initialization

      // with sizing (all array elements are initialized to zero (0)):
      int[] myArray = new int[10];
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString((new int[5])));
      // -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      
      // without values
      String[] days;
      
      // with values:
      String[] a = new String[] {"a","b","c"};
      
      // with values in an anonymous array:
      String[] days = {"Monday","Tuesday"};
      
      // gets compiled but flagged by IDE (local c style array), why?
      String days[];
      String days[] = {"Monday", "Tuesday"};

- Resizing arrays: 
  - By hand: create new reference of original, dereference original variable and copy content of newly created reference in the dereferenced one
  - Use array list (see next point)

### List / ArrayList
- can only be used with classes, not primitives (use wrapper Integer etc. for that, see autoboxing below)
- ArrayList inherits from list (or rather AbstractList interface)
- when adding values to ArrayList, capacity grows automatically
- Ordered collection
- Instantiate with Type in pointy brackets and constructor call with brackets
- append with .add (single item) or .addAll (from collection / list)
- instead of .length property as in arrays, use .size() method
- access items by index with .get(index)
- update with .set(index, newItem)
- remove items with remove (overloaded to accept object to be removed or index (and probably more). 
- more methods such as copying just see example code below
- also a lot of useful .stream() methods  
  
      ArrayList<String> groceryList = new ArrayList<String>();
      // explicit type specification in constructor can be left out:
      ArrayList<String> anotherList = new ArrayList<>();
      groceryList.add("Wurst");
      groceryList.add("Bier");
      groceryList.add("Coke");
      System.out.println(groceryList.toString()); // [Wurst, Bier, Coke]
      groceryList.set(2, "Whisky"); // [Wurst, Bier, Whisky]
      groceryList.remove(1); // [Wurst, Whisky]
      groceryList.remove("Wurst"); // [Whisky]
      groceryList.contains("Whisky"); // true; "contains" returns just indexOf(obj) >= 0
      
      //ways to copy with addAll or ArrayList constructor:
      ArrayList<String> newArrayList = new ArrayList<String>();
      newArrayList.addAll(groceryList);
      ArrayList<String> nextArray = newArrayList<String>(groceryList);
      
      // copy to array
      String[] myArray = new String[groceryList.size()];
      myArray = groceryList.getGroceryList().toArray(myArray); // needs array as param again

      // foreach iteration also possible as in arrays:
      for(String item: groceryList) {
        System.out.println(item);
      }

### Autoboxing / Unboxing

- primitive type ArrayLists must use wrapper class (<Integer>, <Float> etc)
- explicit not necessary when adding values (autoboxing)
- automatically converted back on access (unboxing)
- both at compile time

### Sidenotes

- "enhanced for loop" (basically foreach?):
  
      for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) { System.out.println(arr[i]); }
      // is the same as (ACCESS only, changing "value" doesn't change the array)
      // no index access possible like in most other languages foreach construct
      for (int value : arr) {
            System.out.println(value);
      }

- Copying array
  - Arrays.copyOf(array, array.length)
  - System.arraycopy
  - arrayObj.clone()
  - may more
  - by hand
- Array**s**.stream() has A LOT of useful / functional functions such as map, skip etc.
- skipping first value: `String[] days = Arrays.stream(javaDays).skip(1).toArray(String[]::new);`
- Intellij:
  - Strg-Alt-M to extract selected code to method
  - select, copy, select other, right click + "compare with clipboard" = easy partial diff
