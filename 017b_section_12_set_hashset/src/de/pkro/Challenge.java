    /**
     * When overriding the equals() method in the HeavenlyBody class, we
     * were careful to make sure that it would not return true if a HeavenlyBody
     * was compared to a subclass of itself.
     *
     * We did that to demonstrate that method, but it was actually
     * unnecessary in the HeavenlyBody class.
     *
     * The mini challenge is just a question: why was it unnecessary?
     *
     * Hint: If you are stuck, check out Lecture 97
     *
     * Answer: HeavenlyBody was declared final so no subclassing allowed
